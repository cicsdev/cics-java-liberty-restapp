cics-java-liberty-restapp
===========================

Sample RESTful web application for deployment to a Liberty JVM server in CICS. The application is supplied with two resources:

1. InfoResource - This queries the JVM server environment using system properties and uses JAXB beans to return a JSON response detailing the CICS environment.
1. ReverseResource - This is similar to InfoResource, but uses the JCICS API to link to the COBOL program EDUCHAN using channels and containers. An input string is passed to EDUCHAN, which is then reversed and returned, along with the time from CICS. 

The following Java source components are supplied in the src/Java directory in this repository.

## Java package com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp
* CICSApplication.java - Sets the ApplicationPath for resources in this application
* InfoResource.java - Returns JSON structure using CICSInformation bean
* ReverseResource.java - Returns JSON structure using ReverseResult bean


## Java package com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp.bean
* CICSEnvironment.java - JAXB bean returning JSON structure containing information about CICS product and version
* CICSInformation.java - JAXB bean returning JSON structure containing CICS applid, time and JVM server name and instance of CICSEnvironment
* ReverseResult.java - JAXB bean returning JSON structure containg input and output containers sent to EDUCHAN COBOL program


## Supporting files
* etc/DFHCSD.txt - Output from a DFHCSDUP EXTRACT for the CICS BUNDLE resource definition.
* src/Cobol/EDUCHAN.cbl - A sample CICS COBOL that returns the date and time and reversed input using channels and containers


## Pre-reqs

* CICS TS V5.1 or later, due to the usage of the getString() methods.
* Java SE 1.7 or later on the z/OS system
* Java SE 1.7 or later on the workstation
* Eclipse with WebSphere Developer Tools and CICS Explorer SDK installed

   

## Configuration

The sample Java classes are designed to be added to a dynamic web project and deployed into a Liberty JVM server as a WAR, either using the dropins directory or using 
a CICS bundle project. 



### To add the resources to Eclipse:
1. Using an Eclipse development environment create an dynamic web project called com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp and add the Java samples to the src folder
1. Add the CICS Liberty JVM server libraries to the build path of your project. 
1. Ensure the web project is targeted to compile at a level that is compatible with the Java level being used on CICS. This can be achieved by editing the Java Project Facet in the project properties.
1. Create a CICS bundle project called com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp.cicsbundle and add a dynamic web project include for the project created in step 1.


### To start a JVM server in CICS:
1. Enable Java support in the CICS region by adding the SDFJAUTH library to the STEPLIB concatenation and setting USSHOME and the JVMPROFILEDIR SIT parameters.
1. Define a Liberty JVM server called DFHWLP using the supplied sample definition DFHWLP in the CSD group DFH$WLP.
1. Copy the CICS sample DFHWLP.jvmprofile zFS file to the JVMPROFILEDIR directory specified above and ensure the JAVA_HOME variable is set correctly.
1. Add the jaxrs-1.1 Liberty feature to server.xml.
1. Install the DFHWLP resource defined in step 2 and ensure it becomes enabled.

### To deploy the samples into a CICS region:
1. Using the CICS Explorer export the CICS bundle project to a zFS directory. The samples use the directory /u/cics1/com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp.cicsbundle_1.0.0.
1. Create a CICS BUNDLE definition referencing the zFS directory created in step 1.
1. Install the CICS BUNDLE resource.
1. Download and compile the supplied COBOL program EDUCHAN and deploy into CICS.

**Note:** sample DFHCSDUP EXTRACT output for the required CICS resource definitions is supplied in the supporting file DFHCSD.txt file.  

### Running the Example

#### Using a web browser you can issue the following HTTP GET requests

* http://host:port/com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp/rest/cicsinfo

This will invoke the InfoResource class and return the following JSON response with information about the target CICS system:

{"applid":"IYK2Z32E","jvmServer":"DFHWLP","time":"2016-09-09T16:19:55.384Z","cicsEnvironment":{"cicsProduct":"CICS Transaction Server for z/OS","cicsVersion":"5.3.0"}}


* http://host:port/com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp/rest/reverse

This will invoke the ReverseResource class which links to the CICS COBOL program and reverses the default string "Hello from Java" returning the following JSON response:

{"time":"2016-09-09T16:15:52.756Z","original":"Hello from Java","reverse":"avaJ morf olleH","truncated":false}


* http://host:port/com.ibm.cicsdev.restapp/rest/reverse/ilovecics

This will invoke the ReverseResource class which links to the CICS COBOL program reversing the input string "ilovecics" as follows:

{"time":"2016-09-09T16:15:32.466Z","original":"ilovecics","reverse":"scicevoli","truncated":false}
